Me and Seven have been making a website for my mom's friend, Joanne's business: Gaggle and Thread.
I have been doing layout, and design, and Seven has been doing content, since he has had access to the facebook page, while I didn't.
At one point, our pictures wouldn't work, (as in, they wouldn't show up.) but we fixed that by screenshotting them, and putting them into an "img" folder.
Since I was using bootstrap for the layout, the footer and the carousell wouldn't go al the way to the edge of the screen. It took a while, but I replaced all of the areas that I needed to o to the edge with all new containers. Then the website had a scroll bar that went to the right, even though nothing was over there. I had to look it up, but I was able to turn that function off.
Seven has gotten almost every bit of info that is on the websites, so it would be a wreck without him.
Even with the menacing presence of a deadline, we are making something beautiful!

I have been working on the contents of the files in the site.
I have filled out the order in the files Order, Support, About and pricing.
When makeing the site i made the files to give full explanations.
It is also part of the job to scout for the information such as the business number and location. 
I have found the information in the business Facebook page.
My Partner was responsible for the sites color, design, and look. 
With his great development of a site we are crafting a great site!
